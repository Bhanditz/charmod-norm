        <p>This version of the document represents a significant change from the

      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="intro">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <section id="goals">
        <h3>Goals and Scope</h3>
        <p>The goal of the Character Model for the World Wide Web is to
          facilitate use of the Web by all people, regardless of their language,
          script, writing system, and cultural conventions, in accordance with
          the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission"><cite>W3C goal of
              universal access</cite></a>. One basic prerequisite to achieve
          this goal is to be able to transmit and process the characters used
          around the world in a well-defined and well-understood way.</p>
        <p class="note">This document builds on <cite>Character Model for the
            World Wide Web: Fundamentals</cite> [[!CHARMOD]]. Understanding the
          concepts in that document are important to being able to understand
          and apply this document successfully.</p>
        <p>This part of the Character Model for the World Wide Web covers string
          matching—the process by which a specification or implementation
          defines whether two string values are the same or different from one
          another. It describes the ways in which texts that are semantically
          equivalent can be encoded differently and the impact this has on
          matching operations important to formal languages (such as those used
          in the formats and protocols that make up the Web). Finally, it
          discusses the problem of substring searching within documents.</p>
        <p>The main target audience of this specification is W3C specification
          developers. This specification and parts of it can be referenced from
          other W3C specifications and it defines conformance criteria for W3C
          specifications, as well as other specifications.</p>
        <p>Other audiences of this specification include software developers,
          content developers, and authors of specifications outside the W3C.
          Software developers and content developers implement and use W3C
          specifications. This specification defines some conformance criteria
          for implementations (software) and content that implement and use W3C
          specifications. It also helps software developers and content
          developers to understand the character-related provisions in W3C
          specifications.</p>
        <p>The character model described in this specification provides authors
          of specifications, software developers, and content developers with a
          common reference for consistent, interoperable text manipulation on
          the World Wide Web. Working together, these three groups can build a
          globally accessible Web.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="structure">
        <h3>Structure of this Document</h3>
        <p>This document defines two basic building blocks for the Web related
          to this problem. First, it defines rules and processes for String
          Identity Matching in document formats. These rules are designed for
          the identifiers and structural markup (<a href="#markup">markup</a>)
          used in document formats to ensure consistent processing of each and
          are targeted to Specification writers. Second, it defines broader
          guidelines for handling user visible text (the "Shakespeare"), such as
          natural language text that forms most of the <strong>content</strong>
          of the Web. This section is targeted to implementers.</p>
        <p>This document is divided into three main sections.</p>
        <p>The <a href="#problemStatement">first section</a> lays out the
          problems involved in string matching; the effects of Unicode and
          casefolding on these problems; and outlines the various issues and
          normalization mechanisms that might be used to address these issues.</p>
        <p>The <a href="#identityMatching">second section</a> provides
          requirements and recommendations for string identity matching for use
          in <span class="qterm">format languages</span>, such as document
          formats defined by W3C Specifications. This primarily is concerned
          with making the Web functional and providing document authors with
          consistent results. </p>
        <p>The <a href="#searching">third section</a> discusses considerations
          for the handling of content by implementations, such as browsers or
          text editors on the Web. This mainly is related to how and why to
          preserve the author's original sequences and how to search or find
          content in natural language text. </p>
      </section>
      <section id="background">
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>This section provides some historical background on the topics
          addressed in this specification.</p>
        <p>At the core of the character model is the Universal Character Set
          (UCS), defined jointly by the Unicode Standard [[!UNICODE]] and
          ISO/IEC 10646 [[!ISO10646]]. In this document, <dfn id="unicode" title="unicode">Unicode</dfn>
          is used as a synonym for the Universal Character Set. A successful
          character model allows Web documents authored in the world's writing
          systems, scripts, and languages (and on different platforms) to be
          exchanged, read, and searched by the Web's users around the world.</p>
        <p>The first few chapters of the Unicode Standard [[!UNICODE]] provide
          useful background reading.</p>
        <p>For information about the requirements that informed the development
          of important parts of this specification, see <cite>Requirements for
            String Identity Matching and String Indexing</cite> [[CHARREQ]].</p>
      </section>
      <section id="terminology">
        <h3>Terminology and Notation</h3>
        <p>This section contains terminology and notation specific to this
          document.</p>
        <p>The Web is built on text-based formats and protocols. In order to
          describe string matching or searching effectively, it is necessary to
          establish terminology that allows us to talk about the different kinds
          of text within a given format or protocol, as the requirements and
          details vary significantly. </p>
        <p>Unicode code points are denoted as <code>U+hhhh</code>, where <code>hhhh</code>
          is a sequence of at least four, and at most six hexadecimal digits.
          For example, the character € EURO SIGN has the code point <code>U+20AC</code>.</p>
        <p>Some characters that are used in the various examples might not
          appear as intended unless you have the appropriate font. Care has been
          taken to ensure that the examples nevertheless remain understandable.</p>
        <p id="def-legacyEnc">A <dfn id="legacyEncoding">legacy character
            encoding</dfn> is a character encoding not based on the Unicode
          character set.</p>
        <p id="def-grapheme-cluster">A <dfn id="grapheme_cluster">grapheme
            cluster</dfn> is a sequence of one or more Unicode characters that
          form a single user-perceived "character". Grapheme clusters divide the
          text into units that correspond more closely than character strings to
          the user's perception of where the character boundaries occur in a
          visually rendered text. A discussion of grapheme clusters is given at
          the end of Section 2.10 of the Unicode Standard, [[!UNICODE]]; a
          formal definition is given in Unicode Standard Annex #29 [[!UTR29]].
          What the Unicode Standard actually defines is default grapheme
          clustering. Some languages require tailoring to this default. For
          example, a Slovak user might wish to treat the default pair of
          grapheme clusters "ch" as a single grapheme cluster. Note that the
          interaction between the language of string content and the end-user's
          preferences might be complex.</p>
        <p id="def-grapheme">This document uses the word <dfn id="grapheme">grapheme</dfn>
          as a shorter synonym for a grapheme cluster. Text referring to
          graphemes means the user-perceived character boundary as described
          above.</p>
        <p><dfn id="natural_language_content">Natural language content</dfn>
          refers to the language-bearing content in a document and <b>not</b>
          to any of the surrounding markup or identifiers that form part of the
          document structure. You can think of it as the actual "content" of the
          document or the "message" in a given protocol. Note that the natural
          language content can include items such as the document title ("Much
          Ado About Nothing") as well as prose content within the document.</p>
        <p><dfn id="markup">Markup</dfn> is any text in a document format or
          protocol that belongs to the structure of the format or protocol. This
          definition can include values that are not typically thought of as
          "markup", such as the name of a field in an HTTP header, as well as
          all of the characters that form the structure of a format or protocol.
          For example, <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code> are part of the
          markup in an HTML document. </p>
        <p>Markup usually is defined by a specification or specifications and
          includes both the defined, reserved keywords for the given protocol or
          format as well as string tokens and identifiers that are defined by
          document authors to form the structure of the document (rather than
          the "content" of the document).</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>XML [[XML10]] defines specific elements, attributes, and values
            that are reserved across all XML documents. Thus, the word <code>encoding</code>
            has a defined meaning inside the XML document declaration: it is a
            reserved name. XML also allows a user to define elements and
            attributes for a given document using a DTD. In a document that uses
            a DTD that defines an element called <code>&lt;muffin&gt;</code>,
            "muffin" is a part of the markup.</p>
        </div>
        <p>A <dfn title="resource">resource</dfn> is a given document, file, or
          protocol "message" which include both the <a href="#natural_language_content">natural
            language content</a>) as well as the markup such as identifiers
          surrounding or containing it. For example, in an HTML document that
          also has some CSS and a few <code>script</code> tags with embedded
          JavaScript, the entire HTML document, considered as a file, is the
          resource.</p>
        <p>A <dfn title="vocabulary">vocabulary</dfn> provides the list of
          reserved names as well as the set of rules and specifications
          controlling how user values (such as identifiers) can be assigned in a
          format or protocol. This can include restrictions on range, order, or
          type of characters that can appear in different places. For example,
          HTML defines the names of its elements and attributes, which defines
          the "vocabulary" of HTML markup. ECMAScript restricts the range of
          characters that can appear at the start or in the body of an
          identifier or variable name (while different rules apply to the values
          of, say, string literals).</p>

      <h2>The String Matching Problem</h2>
      <p>The Web uses document formats and protocols that mainly consist of text
        files ("resources") that include some form of structural markup. When
        processing a document format based on text, operations such as string
        matching, indexing, searching, sorting, regular expression matching, and
        so forth become sensitive to the different ways in which text might be
        represented in the document and, as we shall see, there are many ways in
        which text can vary in its representation or encoding. As a result, the
        proper functioning of the Web (and of much other software) depends to a
        large extent on string matching. Failing to consider the different ways
        in which text can be represented or encoded can confuse users or cause
        unexpected or frustrating results.</p>
      <section id="definitionCaseFolding">
        <h3>Casefolding</h3>
        <p>Some scripts and writing systems have a distinction between UPPER,
          lower, and Title case characters. Examples of such a script include
          the Latin script used in the majority of this document, as well as
          scripts such as Greek or Cyrillic. Most scripts, such as the Brahmic
          scripts of India, the Arabic script, and the non-Latin scripts used to
          write Chinese, Japanese, or Korean do not have a case distinction.</p>
        <p>Some document formats or protocols seek to aid interoperability by
          ignoring case variations in the vocabulary they define or in
          user-defined values permitted by the format or protocol. For example,
          this occurs when matching class names between an HTML document and its
          associated style sheet. Consider this HTML fragment: </p>
        <pre>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;

  SPAN.h\e9llo {
     color: red;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;span class="h&amp;#xe9;llo"&gt;<span class="héllo">Hello World!</span>&lt;/span&gt;
</pre>
        <p>The <code>SPAN</code> in the stylesheet matches the <code>span</code>
          element in the document, even though one is uppercase and the other is
          not.</p>
        <p>The process of making two texts which differ in case but are
          otherwise "the same" identical is called "case folding". Case folding
          might, at first, appear simple. However there are variations that need
          to be considered when treating the full range of Unicode in diverse
          languages. For more information, Unicode [[!UNICODE]] Section 5.18
          discusses case folding in detail.</p>
        <p>Case folding in Unicode has a number of side-effects or potential
          side-effects on the source content. One is that case folding may not
          preserve the length of the original text: some mappings increase or
          decrease the total number of characters needed. In addition, case
          folding removes information from a string which cannot be recovered
          later.</p>
        <p>Another aspect of case folding is that it can be language sensitive.
          Unicode defines default case mappings for each encoded character, but
          these are only defaults and are not appropriate in all cases. Some
          languages need case-folding to be tailored to meet specific linguistic
          needs. One common example of this are Turkic languages written in the
          Latin script.</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>The Turkish word "Diyarbakır" contains both the dotted and dotless
            letters "i". When rendered into upper case, this word appears like
            this: "DİYARBAKIR". Notice that the ASCII letter "i" maps to U+0130
            (<code>LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE</code>), while the
            letter "ı" (U+0131 <code>LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I</code>) maps
            to the ASCII uppercase "I". </p>
        </div>
        <p>Case-sensitive matching is the easiest to implement and introduces
          the least potential for confusion, since it generally consists of a
          comparison of the underlying Unicode code point sequence. Because it
          is not affected by considerations such as language-specific case
          mappings, it produces the least surprise for document authors that
          have included words (such as the Turkish example above) in their
          markup.</p>
        <p>Case-insensitive matching is useful in contexts where case may vary
          in a way that is not semantically meaningful or in which case
          distinctions cannot be controlled by the user. This is particularly
          true when <a href="#searching">searching</a> a document, but also
          applies when defining rules for matching user- or content-generated
          values, such as identifiers.</p>

      <section id="unicodeNormalization">
        <h3>Unicode Normalization</h3>
        <p>Other kinds of variations can occur in Unicode text: some
          "characters" or <a href="#def-grapheme">graphemes</a> can be
          represented by several different Unicode code point sequences.
          Consider the character <q>Ǻ</q> <code>LATIN LETTER CAPITAL A WITH
            RING ABOVE AND ACUTE</code>. Here are some of the different ways
          that an HTML document could represent this character:</p>

                <td>Å (U+212B) + &nbsp;́ (U+0301)</td>
                <td>Compatibility character (<code>U+212B ANGSTROM SIGN</code>)

                <td>Compatibility character <code>U+FF21 FULLWIDTH LATIN LETTER
                    CAPITAL A</code>) with combining marks</td>

            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>
        <p>As in the first example, each of the above strings contains the same
          apparent semantic meaning (<q>Ǻ</q>), but each one is encoded slightly
          differently. More variations are possible, but are omitted for
          brevity: for example, any of the characters could be replaced with a
          character escape sequence. </p>
        <p>Because applications need to find the semantic equivalence in texts
          that use different code point sequences, Unicode defines a means of
          making two semantically equivalent texts identical: the Unicode
          Normalization Forms [[!UAX15]].</p>
        <p>Document formats or protocols are sensitive to these variations
          because their specifications and implementations on the Web generally
          do not supply Unicode Normalization of the content being exchanged or
          in the string matching algorithms used when processing the markup and
          content later. Users and resources need to ensure that they have
          provided a consistent representation in order to avoid problems later.
          It can be difficult for users to assure that a given resource or set
          of resources uses a consistent textual representation because the
          differences are usually not visible when viewing a resource as text.
          Tools and implementations thus need to consider the difficulties
          experienced by users when visually or logically equivalent strings
          that "ought to" match (in the user's mind) are considered to be
          distinct values. Providing a means for users to see these differences
          and/or normalize them as appropriate makes it possible for end users
          to avoid failures that spring from invisible differences in their
          source documents. For example, the W3C Validator warns when an HTML
          document is not fully in Unicode Normalization Form C.</p>
        <section id="normalizationForms">
          <h4>Unicode Normalization Forms</h4>
          <p>Unicode defines two types of equivalence between characters: <em>canonical
              equivalence</em> and <em>compatibility equivalence</em>.</p>
          <p><dfn title="canonical equivalence">Canonical equivalence</dfn> is a
            fundamental equivalency between Unicode characters or sequences of
            Unicode characters that represent the same abstract character. When
            correctly displayed, these should always have the same visual
            appearance and behavior. Generally speaking, two canonically
            equivalent Unicode texts should be considered to be identical as
            text. Canonical decomposition removes primary distinctions between
            two texts. </p>

          <p><dfn title="compatibility equivalence">Compatibility equivalence</dfn>
            is a weaker equivalence between characters or sequences of
            characters that represent the same abstract character, but may have
            a different visual appearance or behavior. Generally a compatibility
            decomposition removes formatting variations, such as superscript,
            subscript, rotated, circled, and so forth, but other variations also
            occur. In many cases, characters with compatibility decompositions
            represent a distinction of a semantic nature; replacing the use of
            distinct characters with their compatibility decomposition can
            therefore cause problems and texts that are equivalent after
            compatibility decomposition often were not perceived as being
            identical beforehand and usually should not be treated as equivalent
            by a formal language.</p>

            <p>In the above table, it is important to note that the characters
              illustrated are <em>actual Unicode codepoints</em>. They were
              encoded into Unicode for compatibility with various legacy
              character encodings. They should not be confused with the normal
              kinds of presentational processing used on their non-compatibility
              counterparts. </p>
            <p>For example, most Arabic-script text uses the characters in the
              Arabic script block of Unicode (around U+0600). The actual glyphs
              used in the text are selected using fonts and text processing
              logic based on the position inside a word (initial, medial, final,
              or isolated), in a process called "shaping". In the table above,
              the four presentation forms of the Arabic letter NOON are shown.
              The characters shown are compatibility characters in the U+FE00
              block, each of which represents a specific "positional" shape and
              each of the four code points shown have a compatibility
              decomposition to the "regular" Arabic letter NOON (U+0646).</p>
            <p>Similarly, the variations in East Asian width and the rotated
              bracket (for use in vertical text) are encoded as separate code
              points.</p>
            <p>In the case of characters with compatibility decompositions, such
              as those shown above, the "K" Unicode Normalization forms convert
              the text to the "normal" or "expected" Unicode code point. But the
              existence of these compatibility characters cannot be taken to
              imply that similar appearance variations produced in the normal
              course of text layout and presentation are affected by Unicode
              Normalization. They are not.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="ednote">Improve above examples, which are taken from UAX15,
            by adding more of each type and clarifying the "breaking
            differences" item. The table seems to be confused with "normal"
            character sequences—which isn't the point. Perhaps a better
            illustration than Unicode's is needed. 😿</p>
          <p>These two types of Unicode-defined equivalence are then grouped by
            another pair of variations: "decomposition" and "composition". In
            "decomposition", separable logical parts of a visual character are
            broken out into a sequence of base characters and combining marks
            and the resulting code points are put into a fixed, canonical order.
            In "composition", the decomposition is performed and then any
            combining marks are recombined, if possible, with their base
            characters. Note that this does <strong>not</strong> mean that all
            of the combining marks have been removed from the resulting
            normalized text. </p>
          <p>The Unicode Normalization Forms are named using letter codes, with
            'C' standing for Composition, 'D' for Decomposition, and 'K' for
            Compatibility decomposition. Having converted a resource to a
            sequence of Unicode characters and unescaped any escape sequences,
            we can finally "normalize" the Unicode texts given in the example
            above. Here are the resulting sequences in each Unicode
            Normalization form for the U+01FA example given earlier: </p>

          <p>Unicode Normalization reduces these (and other potential sequences
            of escapes representing the same character) to just three possible
            variations. However, Unicode Normalization doesn't remove all
            textual distinctions and sometimes the application of Unicode
            Normalization can remove meaning that is distinctive or meaningful
            in a given context. For example: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Not all compatibility characters have a compatibility
              decomposition.</li>
            <li>Some characters that look alike or have similar semantics are
              actually distinct in Unicode and don't have canonical or
              compatibility decompositions to link them together. For example, <code>U+3001
                IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP</code> is used as a "period" at the end of
              sentences in languages such as Chinese or Japanese. However, it is
              not considered equivalent to the ASCII "period" character <code>U+002E
                FULL STOP</code>.</li>
            <li>Some character variations are not handled by normalization. For
              example, UPPER, Title, and lowercase variations are a separate and
              distinct textual variation that must be separately normalized.</li>
            <li>Normalization can remove meaning. For example, <code>8½</code>
              (including the character <code>U+00BD VULGAR FRACTION ONE HALF</code>),
              when normalized using one of the "compatibility" normalization
              forms, becomes a character sequence that looks more like: <code>81/2</code>.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Choice of Normalization Form</h4>
          <p>Given that there are many character sequences that content authors
            or applications could choose when inputting or exchanging text, and
            that when providing text in a normalized form, there are different
            options for the normalization form to be used, what form is most
            appropriate for content on the Web?</p>
          <p>For use on the Web, it is important not to lose compatibility
            distinctions, which are often important to the content (see
            [[UNICODE-XML]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/unicode-xml/#Compatibility">Chapter
              5</a> for a discussion). The NFKD and NFKC normalization forms are
            therefore excluded. Among the remaining two forms, NFC has the
            advantage that almost all legacy data (if transcoded trivially,
            one-to-one, to a Unicode encoding), as well as data created by
            current software, is already in this form; NFC also has a slight
            compactness advantage and is a better match to user expectations
            with respect to the character vs. <a href="#def-grapheme">grapheme</a>
            issue. This document therefore recommends, when possible, that all
            content be stored and exchanged in Unicode Normalization Form C
            (NFC).</p>
          <div class="note">
            <p>Roughly speaking, <abbr title="Normalization Form C">NFC</abbr>
              is defined such that each combining character sequence (a base
              character followed by one or more combining characters) is
              replaced, as far as possible, by a canonically equivalent
              precomposed character. Text in a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/REC-charmod-20050215/#Unicode_Encoding_Form">Unicode
                encoding form</a> is said to be in NFC if it doesn't contain any
              combining sequence that could be replaced and if any remaining
              combining sequence is in canonical order.</p>

      </section>
      <section id="characterEscapes">
        <h3>Character Escapes</h3>
        <p>Document formats or protocols also generally provide escaping
          mechanisms to permit the inclusion of characters that are otherwise
          difficult to input, process, or encode. These escape mechanisms
          provide an additional equivalent means of representing characters
          inside a given resource. These allow for the encoding of characters
          not represented in the character encoding scheme used by the document
          or for convenience of the editor. </p>
        <p>For example, € (<code>U+20AC EURO SIGN</code>) can also be encoded in
          HTML as the hexadecimal entity <code>&amp;#x20ac;</code> or as the
          decimal entity <code>&amp;#8364;</code>. In a JavaScript or JSON
          file, it can appear as <code>\u20ac</code> while in a CSS stylesheet
          it can appear as <code>\20ac</code>. All of these representations
          encode the same literal character value: "€".</p>
        <p>Character escapes are normally interpreted before a document is
          processed and strings within the format or protocol are matched.
          Returning to an example we used above: </p>
        <pre>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;

  span.h\e9llo {
     color: red;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;span class="h&amp;#xe9;llo"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/span&gt;
</pre>
        <p>You would expect that text to display like the following: <span class="héllo">Hello
            world!</span></p>
        <p>In order for this to work, the user-agent (browser) had to match two
          strings representing the class name <code>héllo</code>, even though
          the CSS and HTML each used a different escaping mechanism. The above
          fragment demonstrates one way that text can vary and still be
          considered "the same" according to a specification: the class name <code>h\e9llo</code>
          matched the class name in the HTML mark-up <code>h&amp;#xe9;llo</code>
          (and would also match the literal value <code>héllo</code> using the
          code point <code>U+00E9</code>).</p>

        <h3>Unicode Controls and Invisible Markers</h3>
        <p>Unicode provides a number of special purpose control characters or
          invisible markers that help document authors control the appearance or
          performance of text. These characters interfere with string matching
          when they are not semantically part of the text but do form part of
          the encoded character sequence. </p>
        <p>A special case is for ZWJ and ZWNJ. These invisible controls
          sometimes affect meaning.</p>

        <h3>Legacy Character Encodings</h3>
        <p>Finally, resources can use different character encoding schemes,
          including <a href="#def-legacyEnc">legacy character encodings</a>, to
          serialize document formats on the Web. Each character encoding scheme
          uses different syntax, byte values, and sequences to represent a given
          subset of the Universal Character Set.</p>
        <p>For example, € (<code>U+20AC EURO SIGN</code>) is encoded as <code>0x80</code>
          in the <code>windows-1252</code> encoding, but as the byte sequence <code>0xE2.82.AC</code>
          in <code>UTF-8</code>.</p>
        <p>Specifications mainly address these resulting variations by
          considering each document to be a sequence of Unicode characters after
          converting from the document's character encoding (be it a legacy
          character encoding or a Unicode encoding such as UTF-8) and then
          unescaping any character escapes before proceeding to process the
          document. </p>
        <p class="ednote">The following paragraphs about normalization
          transcoders are "at risk". The WG feels that this requirement is
          difficult for content authors or implementers to verify. Needed
          action: verify if all of [[Encoding]] spec's transcoders are
          normalizing.</p>
        <p class="note">Even within a single legacy character encoding there can
          be variations in implementation. One famous example is the legacy
          Japanese encoding <code>Shift_JIS</code>. Different transcoder
          implementations faced choices about how to map specific byte sequences
          to Unicode. So the byte sequence <code>0x80.60</code> (<code>0x2141</code>
          in the JIS X 0208 character set) was mapped by some implementations to
          <code>U+301C WAVE DASH</code> while others chose <code>U+FF5E FULL
            WIDTH TILDE</code>. This means that two reasonable, self-consistent,
          transcoders could produce different Unicode character sequences from
          the same input. The [[Encoding]] specification exists, in part, to
          ensure that Web implementations use interoperable and identical
          mappings. However, extant transcoders might be applied to documents
          found on the Web.</p>
        <p>For content authors and implementations, it is RECOMMENDED that
          conversions from legacy character encodings use a "normalizing
          transcoder".</p>
        <p id="def-normalizing-transcoder">A <span class="new-term">normalizing
            transcoder</span> is a transcoder that converts from a <a title=""

            encoding form</a> <em>and</em> ensures that the result is in
          Unicode Normalization Form C. For most legacy character encodings, it
          is possible to construct a normalizing transcoder (by using any
          transcoder followed by a normalizer); it is not possible to do so if

      <h2>String Matching of Markup in Document Formats and Protocols</h2>
      <p>This chapter defines the implementation and requirements for string
        matching in markup.</p>
      <!-- 
           ##  Although lovely, the following text repeats everything that        ##  came before. Reluctantly, I'm        ##  commenting it out.      <p>One important operation that depends on the use of consistent character sequences is <span class="new-term">string identity matching</span> [[CHARREQ]], which is a    subset of the more general problem of string matching. There are various    degrees of specificity for string matching, from approximate matching such as    regular expressions or phonetic matching, to more specific matches such as    case-insensitive or accent-insensitive matching and finally to identity    matching. </p>  <p>Examples of string identity matching abound: parsing element and    attribute names in Web documents, matching CSS selectors to the nodes in a    document, matching font names in a style sheet to the names known to the    operating system, matching URI pieces to the resources in a server, matching    strings embedded in an ECMAScript program to strings typed in by a Web form    user, matching the parts of an XPath expression (element names, attribute names    and values, content, etc.) to what is found in an XML instance, etc.</p>  <p>String identity matching can take several forms. The most trivial of these is performed by    comparing two strings code unit-by-code unit (in multibyte encodings, this is byte-by-byte). The existence on the Web of multiple    means of representing characters means that this process is actually less trivial than it appears. Binary    comparison does not work if the strings are not in the same    character encoding (e.g. an EBCDIC style sheet being directly applied to an ASCII    document, or a font specification in a Shift_JIS style sheet directly used on a    system that maintains font names in UTF-16) or if they are in the same character encoding    but if the 'same' string contains variations allowed for by the use of    combining characters or by the constructs of Web languages. Even when a consistent character encoding based on Unicode is used, defining string equality is hampered by the availability of multiple Unicode representations of the same canonical character or grapheme.</p>  <p>Incorrect string identity matching can have far reaching consequences,    including the creation of security holes. Consider a contract, encoded in XML,    for buying goods: each item sold is described in a <code>Stück</code> element;    unfortunately, &quot;<span class="quote">Stück</span>&quot; is subject to different representations    in the character encoding of the contract. Suppose that the contract is viewed    and signed by means of a user agent that looks for <code>Stück</code> elements,    extracts them (matching on the element name), presents them to the user and    adds up their prices. If different instances of the <code>Stück</code> element    happen to be represented differently in a particular contract, then the buyer    and seller may see (and sign) different contracts if their respective user    agents perform string identity matching differently, which is fairly likely in    the absence of a well-defined specification for string matching. The absence of    a well-defined specification would also mean that there would be no way to    resolve the ensuing contractual dispute.</p>  <p>Ideally <span class="new-term">identity</span> would only occur    if the compared strings contained no user-identifiable distinctions.    That is, strings do not match when they differ in case or    accentuation, but do match when they differ only in non-semantically    significant ways such as character encoding, use of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/REC-charmod-20050215/#sec-Escaping">character escapes</a> (of potentially different kinds), or use of precomposed vs.    decomposed character sequences.</p>            ## end of the removed block ##        -->

        <h2>The Matching Algorithm</h2>
        <p>This section defines the algorithm for matching strings. String
          identity matching MUST be performed as if the following steps were
          followed: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Conversion to a common Unicode encoding form of the strings to be
            compared [[Encoding]].</li>
          <li>
            <p>Expansion of all character escapes and includes.</p>
            <div class="note">
              <p>The expansion of character escapes and includes is dependent on
                context, that is, on which markup or programming language is
                considered to apply when the string matching operation is
                performed. Consider a search for the string '<span class="qterm">suçon</span>'
                in an XML document containing <code>su&amp;#xE7;on</code> but
                not <code>suçon</code>. If the search is performed in a plain
                text editor, the context is <span class="new-term">plain text</span>
                (no markup or programming language applies), the &amp;#xE7;
                character escape is not recognized, hence not expanded and the
                search fails. If the search is performed in an XML browser, the
                context is <code>XML</code>, the character escape (defined by
                XML) is expanded and the search succeeds. </p>
              <p>An intermediate case would be an XML editor that <em>purposefully</em>
                provides a view of an XML document with entity references left
                unexpanded. In that case, a search over that pseudo-XML view
                will deliberately <em>not</em> expand entities: in that
                particular context, entity references are not considered
                includes and need not be expanded</p>

        <p>There are three types of casefold matching defined for the purposes
          of string identity matching in document formats or protocols:</p>
        <p id="case-sensitive"><dfn title="case sensitive">Case sensitive
            matching</dfn>: code points are compared directly with no case
          folding. Case sensitive matching is RECOMMENDED as the default for any
          new protocol or format.</p>
        <p id="uci"><dfn title="Unicode case insensitive">Unicode
            case-insensitive matching</dfn> compares a sequence of code points
          as-if one of the Unicode-defined language-independent default case
          folding forms (see [[!UNICODE]], Section 5.18) had been applied to
          both input sequences. These forms are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> Unicode Full Casefold (C+F). This case-fold form is RECOMMENDED
            for Web specifications and implementations. This case-fold uses the
            "common" plus the "full" case-fold.</li>
          <li>Unicode Simple Casefold (C+S). Unicode also defines a "common"
            plus "simple" case-fold. This form is not appropriate for string
            identity matching on the Web.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="note">
          <p>In the rare case where a document format or protocol contains
            information about the language of the markup and where
            language-sensitive processing might sensibly be applied, tailoring
            of the Unicode case-fold mappings above to match the expectations of
            that language might be specified and applied. These case-fold
            mappings are defined in the <cite>Common Locale Data Repository</cite>
            [[UAX35]] project of the Unicode Consortium.</p>
          <p>However, language-sensitive case-sensitive matching in document
            formats and protocols is NOT RECOMMENDED because language
            information can be hard to obtain, verify, or manage and the
            resulting operations can produce results that frustrate users.</p>

        <p id="aci"><dfn title="ASCII case insensitive">ASCII case-insensitive

      <section id="identityMatchReqs">
        <h2>Requirements for String Identity Matching</h2>
        <p>In the Web environment, where multiple character encodings are used
          to represent strings, including some character encodings which allow
          multiple representations for the same thing, it's important to
          establish a consistent process for evaluating string identity.</p>
        <p>One main consideration in string identity matching is whether the
          comparison is case sensitive or case insensitive.</p>
        <div class="requirement">
          <p>[S] <a href="#case-sensitive">Case sensitive</a> matching is
            RECOMMENDED as the default for new protocols and formats.</p>
        </div>
        <p>However, cases exist in which case-insensitivity is desirable.</p>
        <p>Where case-insensitive matching is desired, there are several
          implementation choices that a formal language needs to consider. If
          the vocabulary of strings to be compared is limited to the Basic Latin
          (ASCII) subset of Unicode, <a href="#aci">ASCII-case-insensitive</a>
          matching MAY be used.</p>
        <p>If the vocabulary of strings to be compared is not limited, then <a
            href="#aci">ASCII case-insensitive</a> matching MUST NOT be used. <a
            href="#uci">Unicode case-insensitive</a> matching MUST be applied,
          even if the vocabulary does not allow the full range of Unicode.</p>
        <p><a href="#uci">Unicode case-insensitive</a> matching can take several
          forms. Unicode defines the "common" (C) casefoldings for characters
          that always have 1:1 mappings of the character to its case folded form
          and this covers the majority of characters that have a case folding. A
          few characters in Unicode have a 1:many case folding. This 1:many
          mapping is called the "full" (F) case fold mapping. For compatibility
          with certain types of implementation, Unicode also defines a "simple"
          (S) case fold that is always 1:1.</p>
        <div class="requirement">
          <p>Because the "simple" case-fold mapping removes information that can
            be important to forming an identity match, the "Common plus Full"
            (or CF) case fold mapping is RECOMMENDED for Unicode
            case-insensitive matching.</p>
        </div>
        <p>A vocabulary is considered to be "ASCII-only" if and only if all
          tokens and identifiers are defined by the specification directly and
          these identifiers or tokens use only the Basic Latin subset of
          Unicode. If user-defined identifiers are permitted, the full range of
          Unicode characters (limited, as appropriate, for security or
          interchange concerns, see [[UTR36]]) SHOULD be allowed and Unicode
          case insensitivity used for identity matching.</p>
        <div class="requirement">
          <p>ASCII case-insensitive matching MUST only be applied to
            vocabularies that are restricted to ASCII. Unicode
            case-insensitivity MUST be used for all other vocabularies.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Note that an ASCII-only vocabulary can exist inside a document format
          or protocol that allows a larger range of Unicode in identifiers or

            protocols to store or exchange data in a normalized form unless
            there are specific, clear reasons why the additional requirement is
            necessary. As many document formats on the Web do not require
            normalization, content authors might occasionally rely on
            denormalized character sequences and a normalization step could
            negatively affect such content.</p>
          <div class="note">
            <p>Requiring NFC requires additional care on the part of the
              specification developer, as content on the Web generally is not in
              a known normalization state. Boundary and error conditions for
              denormalized content need to be carefully considered and well
              specified in these cases. </p>

      <h2>String Searching in Natural Language Content</h2>
      <p>Many Web implementations and applications have a different sort of
        string matching requirement from the one described above: the need for
        users to search documents for particular words or phrases of text. This
        section addresses the various considerations that an implementer might
        need to consider when implementing natural language text processing on
        the Web <em>other than</em> that mandated by a formal language or
        document format.</p>
      <p>There are several different kinds of string searching.</p>
      <p>When you are using a search engine, you are generally using a form of <dfn
          id="fts">full text search</dfn>. Full text search generally breaks
        natural language text into word segments and may apply complex
        processing to get at the semantic "root" values of words. For example,
        if the user searches for "run", you might want to find words like
        "running", "ran", or "runs" in addition to the actual search term "run".
        This process, naturally, is sensitive to language, context, and many
        other aspects of textual variation. It is also beyond the scope of this
        document.</p>
      <p>Another form of string searching, which we'll concern ourselves with
        here, is sub-string matching or "find" operations. This is the direct
        searching of the body or "corpus" of a document with the user's input.
        Find operations can have different options or implementation details,
        such as the addition or removal of case sensitivity, or whether the
        feature supports different aspects of a regular expression language or
        "wildcards".</p>
      <section id="searchingConsiderations">
        <h2>Considerations for Matching Natural Language Content</h2>
        <p class="ednote">This section was identified as a new area needing
          document as part of the overall rearchitecting of the document. The
          text here is incomplete and needs further development. Contributions
          from the community are invited.</p>
        <p>Searching content (one example is using the "find" command in your
          browser) generates different user expectations and thus has different
          requirements from the need for absolute identity matching needed by
          document formats and protocols. Searching text has different
          contextual needs and often provides different features.</p>
        <p>One description of Unicode string searching can be found in Section 8
          (Searching and Matching) of [[UTS10]].</p>
        <p>One of the primary considerations for string searching is that, quite
          often, the user's input is not identical to the way that the text is
          encoded in the text being searched. Users generally expect matching to
          be more "promiscuous", particularly when they don't add additional
          effort to their input. For example, they expect a term entered in
          lowercase to match uppercase equivalents. Conversely, when the user
          expends more effort on the input—by using the shift key to produce
          uppercase or by entering a letter with diacritics instead of just the
          base letter—they expect their search results to match (only) their
          more-specific input.</p>
        <p>This effect might vary depending on context as well. For example, a
          person using a physical keyboard may have direct access to accented
          letters, while a virtual or on-screen keyboard may require extra
          effort to access and select the same letters.</p>
        <p>Consider a document containing these strings: "re-resume",
          "RE-RESUME", "re-rèsumé", and "RE-RÈSUMÉ".</p>
        <p>In the table below, the user's input (on the left) might be
          considered a match for the above items as follows:</p>
        <table class="TableGen" style="width:95%; margin-left:5%;">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th scope="col">User Input</th>
              <th scope="col">Matched Strings</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>e (lowercase 'e')</td>
              <td>"re-resume", "RE-RESUME", "re-rèsumé", and "RE-RÈSUMÉ"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>E (uppercase 'E')</td>
              <td>"RE-RESUME" and "RE-RÈSUMÉ"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>è (lowercase 'e' with accent grave)</td>
              <td>"re-rèsumé" and "RE-RÈSUMÉ"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>È</td>
              <td>"RE-RÈSUMÉ"</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>In addition to variations of case or the use of accents, Unicode also
          has an array of canonical equivalents or compatibility characters (as
          described in the sections above) that might impact string searching.</p>
        <p>For example, consider the letter "K". Characters with a compatibility
          mapping to <code>U+004B LATIN CAPITAL LETTER K</code> include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Ķ U+0136</li>
          <li>Ǩ U+01E8</li>
          <li>ᴷ U+1D37</li>
          <li>Ḱ U+1E30</li>
          <li>Ḳ U+1E32</li>
          <li>Ḵ U+1E34</li>
          <li>K U+212A</li>
          <li>Ⓚ U+24C0</li>
          <li>㎅ U+3385</li>
          <li>㏍ U+33CD</li>
          <li>㏎ U+33CE</li>
          <li>Ｋ U+FF2B</li>
          <li>(a variety of mathematical symbols such as
            U+1D40A,U+1D43E,U+1D472,U+1D4A6,U+1D4DA)</li>
          <li>🄚 U+1F11A</li>
          <li>🄺 U+1F13A.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Other differences include Unicode Normalization forms (or lack
          thereof). There are also ignorable characters (such as the variation
          selectors), whitespace differences, bidirectional controls, and other
          code points that can interfere with a match. </p>
        <p>Users might also expect certain kinds of equivalence to be applied to
          matching. For example, a Japanese user might expect that hiragana,
          katakana, and half-width compatibility katakana equivalents all match
          each other (regardless of which is used to perform the selection or
          encoded in the text). </p>
        <p>When searching text, the concept of "grapheme boundaries" and
          "user-perceived characters" can be important. See Section 3 of <cite>Character
            Model for the World Wide Web: Fundamentals</cite> [[!CHARMOD]] for a
          description. For example, if the user has entered a capital "A" into a
          search box, should the software find the character À (<code>U+00C0
            LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACCENT GRAVE</code>)? What about the
          character "A" followed by U+0300 (a combining accent grave)? What
          about writing systems, such as Devanagari, which use combining marks
          to suppress or express certain vowels?</p>
